Here's a possible implementation in Python:

```python
class Transaction:
    def __init__(self, amount, _type):
        self.amount = amount
        self._type = _type

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, number, owner, balance=0):
        self.number = number
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance
        self.transactions = []

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        transaction = Transaction(amount, 'Deposit')
        self.transactions.append(transaction)
        
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.balance < amount:
            return 'Insufficient Funds'
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            transaction = Transaction(amount, 'Withdrawal')
            self.transactions.append(transaction)
            
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name, account):
        self.name = name
        self.account = account

class Bank:
    def __init__(self):
        self.customers = []

    def add_customer(self, customer):
        self.customers.append(customer)

    def remove_customer(self, customer):
        self.customers.remove(customer)
```
This code defines four classes according to the provided diagrams. The `Transaction` class represents a single transaction, with attributes for the transaction amount and type. The `BankAccount` class models a bank account with methods for depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as storing past transactions. The `Customer` class combines a person's name with their associated `BankAccount`. Finally, the `Bank` class manages a collection of `Customer` objects.
