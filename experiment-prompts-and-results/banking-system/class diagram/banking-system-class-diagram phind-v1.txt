Here is the Python implementation for your request:
```python
from typing import List

class Transaction:
    def __init__(self, amount:float, type:str):
        self.amount = amount
        assert type in ["Withdrawal", "Deposit"]
        self.type = type

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, number:str, owner:str, balance:float=0.0, transactions:List[Transaction]=[]):
        self.number = number
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance
        self.transactions = transactions

    def deposit(self, amount:float)->str:
        self.balance += amount
        transaction = Transaction(amount, "Deposit")
        self.transactions.append(transaction)
        return f'Amount {amount}$ was successfully deposited.'

    def withdraw(self, amount:float)->str:
        if (self.balance < amount):
            return 'Insufficient funds'
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            transaction = Transaction(amount, "Withdrawal")
            self.transactions.append(transaction)
            return f'Amount {amount}$ was successfully withdrawn.'

class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name:str, account:BankAccount):
        self.name = name
        self.account = account

class Bank:
    def __init__(self, customers:List[Customer]=[]):
        self.customers = customers

    def add_customer(self, customer:Customer):
        self.customers.append(customer)
