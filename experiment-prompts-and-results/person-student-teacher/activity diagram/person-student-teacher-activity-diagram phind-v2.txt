Here is a possible implementation in Python:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def introduce(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}. I am {self.age} years old."

        
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, grade):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.grade = grade
    
    def study(self, hours):
        return f"{self.name} has been studying for {hours} hours."
      
    def get_profile(self):
        return f"Name: {self.name}\nAge: {self.age}\nGrade: {self.grade}"


class Teacher(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, subject):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.subject = subject
    
    def teach(self, topic):
        return f"{self.name} is teaching about {topic} in {self.subject}."
    
    def grade_student(self, student, grade):
        if isinstance(student, Student):
            student.grade = grade
        else:
            print("The provided object is not a Student.")
```
This code defines three classes: `Person`, `Student` which inherits from `Person`, and `Teacher` which also inherits from `Person`. The methods defined in each class correspond to the actions described in the diagrams.
